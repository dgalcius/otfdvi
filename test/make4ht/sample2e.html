<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   This is an example input file. Comparing it with the output it generates can show
you how to produce a simple document of your own.
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Ordinary Text</h3>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >The ends of words and sentences are marked by spaces. It doesn&#8217;t matter how
many spaces you type; one is as good as 100. The end of a line counts as a
space.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   One or more blank lines denote the end of a paragraph.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Since any number of consecutive spaces are treated like a single one, the
formatting of the input file makes no difference to <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>, but it makes a difference
to you. When you use <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>, making your input file as easy to read as
possible will be a great help as you write your document and when you change
it. This sample file shows how you can add comments to your own input
file.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Because printing is different from typewriting, there are a number of things that
you have to do differently when preparing an input file than if you were
just typing the document directly. Quotation marks like &#8220;this&#8221; have to be
handled specially, as do quotes within quotes: &#8220; &#8216;this&#8217; is what I just wrote, not
&#8216;that&#8217; &#8221;.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   Dashes come in three sizes: an intra-word dash, a medium dash for number ranges
like 1&#8211;2, and a punctuation dash&#8212;like this.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   A sentence-ending space should be larger than the space between words within a
sentence. You sometimes have to type special commands in conjunction with
punctuation characters to get this right, as in the following sentence. Gnats, gnus,
etc.&#x00A0;all begin with G. You should check the spaces after periods when reading your
output to make sure you haven&#8217;t forgotten any special cases. Generating
an ellipsis &#x2026;&#x00A0;with the right spacing around the periods requires a special

command.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>&#x00A0;interprets some common characters as commands, so you must type
special commands to generate them. These characters include the following: $ &amp; % #
<span 
class="cmsy-10">{ </span>and <span 
class="cmsy-10">}</span>.
</p><!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   In printing, text is usually emphasized with an <span 
class="cmti-10">italic </span>type style.
</p><!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-10">A long segment of text can also be emphasized in this way. Text within such a</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">segment can be given </span>additional <span 
class="cmti-10">emphasis.</span>
</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   It is sometimes necessary to prevent <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>&#x00A0;from breaking a line where it might
otherwise do so. This may be at a space, as between the &#8220;Mr.&#8221;&#x00A0;and &#8220;Jones&#8221; in
&#8220;Mr.&#x00A0;Jones&#8221;, or within a word&#8212;especially when the word is a symbol like <span 
class="cmti-10">itemnum</span>
that makes little sense when hyphenated across lines.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   Footnotes<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="sample2e2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>
pose no problem.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>&#x00A0;is good at typesetting mathematical formulas like <img 
src="sample2e0x.png" alt="x- 3y+ z = 7  "  class="math"  /> or
<img 
src="sample2e1x.png" alt="      2n    2n   &#x2032;
a1 &#x003E; x  + y  &#x003E; x "  class="math"  /> or <img 
src="sample2e2x.png" alt="       &#x2211;
(A, B) =   iaibi  "  class="math"  />. The spaces you type in a formula are
ignored. Remember that a letter like <span 
class="cmmi-10">x </span>is a formula when it denotes a mathematical
symbol, and it should be typed as one.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Displayed Text</h3>
<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >Text is displayed by indenting it from the left margin. Quotations are commonly
displayed. There are short quotations
     </p><div class="quote">
     <!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >This is a short quotation. It consists of a single paragraph of text.
     See how it is formatted.</p></div>
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" >and longer ones.
        </p><div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >    This is a longer quotation. It consists of two paragraphs of text,
     neither of which are particularly interesting.
     </p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   This is the second paragraph of the quotation. It is just as dull
     as the first paragraph.</p></div>
<!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >Another frequently-displayed structure is a list. The following is an example of an
<span 
class="cmti-10">itemized </span>list. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">This is the first item of an itemized list. Each item in the list is marked
     with a &#8220;tick&#8221;. You don&#8217;t have to worry about what kind of tick mark is
     used.

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This is the second item of the list. It contains another list nested inside it. The
     inner list is an <span

         <ol  class="enumerate1" >
         <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2002x1">This is the first item of an enumerated list that is nested within the

         lists deeper than you really should.</li></ol>
     <!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >This is the rest of the second item of the outer list. It is no more interesting
     than any other part of the item.
     </p></li>
     <li class="itemize">This is the third item of the list.</li></ul>
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >You can even display poetry. </p><div class="verse">
        <!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" > There is an environment for verse<br />
        Whose features some poets will curse.

        Them do <span 
class="cmti-10">all </span>line breaking,<br />
        It allows them to put too many words on a line when they&#8217;d
        rather be forced to be terse.

</div>
   Mathematical formulas may also be displayed. A displayed formula is one-line
long; multiline formulas require special formatting instructions.
