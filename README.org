#+TITLE: DVI with OTF to PS (or PDF)

* Problem 1
  
  lualatex can produce a DVI file with OpenType files.
  Standard DVIPS cannot produce a PS file from such a DVI.

* Solution 1

  This is more a workaround that a solution.
  The idea is to convert a DVI with OTF fonts to DVI without
  OTF fonts that  dvips can understand

  #+BEGIN_SRC latex
\documentclass{article}     
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}             
A G
\end{document}
  #+END_SRC
